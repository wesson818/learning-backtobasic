Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps

React-redux is a library that provides bindings to use React and Redux together in an application

- A store that holds the state of your application.
- An action that describes the changes in the state of the application.
- A reducer which actually carries out the state transition depending on the action.

JS app (dispatch)=> Action => Reducer => Redux Store (State)
